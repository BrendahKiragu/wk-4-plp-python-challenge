Why Didn’t I Meet You Sooner, Python? 🐍

I’ve walked the long, curly-braced lane,
Where semicolons dance in vain,
Where const and let forever fight,
And callbacks haunt me late at night.

I thought JavaScript was my home,
Through React’s wild seas I’d roam.
I battled undefined and scope,
Clung to promises, lost all hope.

Then one soft day, I met you
A snake so simple, syntax true.
No curly braces, no trailing pain,
Just clean white space, I breathe again.

Your lists, your dicts, your gentle flow,
I whisper print and watch it go.
No semicolons to make me weep,
Just indentation, pure and deep.

JavaScript was my fiery fling,
But, Python, you… you make me sing.
Why didn’t I find your love back then,
Before I nested loops in sin?

Now, dear snake, I make my vow,
To learn your secrets, here and now.
JS may linger, it’s still my mate,
But Python, oh Python,
…you’re my soulmate. ❤️

Happy coding.
